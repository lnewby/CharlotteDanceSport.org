<h3 id="q1">When and where are lessons held?</h3>  
<p>Lessons are held on Sundays in the Cone Center's Lucas Room<!--(put map here)-->.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Silver is 1P-3P, Bronze is 3P-5P</li>
<li>Newcomer is 4P-5P</li>
<li>Social is from 5P-6P</li>
</ul>  
<p>There is an additional Newcomer lesson in the Student Activity Center's (SAC) Aerobics room.  This is on Wednesday night from 8P-9P.  For Wednesday night lessons only, non-students must be a guest of a student to get into the SAC and pay a $5 entry to the building.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q2">Do I need a partner?</h3>
<p>You do not need a partner to attend lessons.  Partners rotate throughout the lessons so everybody will get a chance to participate.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q3">Do I have to be a student at UNCC?</h3>
<p>You do not have to be a student at UNCC.  Many members of the club are either students from other schools or members of the community who do not have any affiliation with the school other than the club.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q4">What should I wear to lessons?</h3>
<p>Wear modest, comfortable clothing that will not restrict your movement.  If you do not have dance shoes, any shoe that is not rubber soled and will not stick to the floor will suffice (aka no tennis shoes). Many beginners get by with just wearing socks.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q5">What's the difference between Social, Newcomer Team, Bronze Team, and Silver Team?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social</strong> You will learn enough basic steps to be able to get out on the dance floor and dance to music.  This is open to anybody and is free.  Social is taught by advanced members of the club.</li>
<li><strong>Newcomer Team</strong> You will continue to learn what was taught in Social, with the addition of technique for competitive dancing being introduced.  This is open to anybody.  Semester dues are $25 for students and $45 for non-students.  Typically people join the Newcomer team with the intent of competing but you do not have to compete (although it is encouraged).  These lessons are taught by the advanced members of the club.</li>
<li><strong>Bronze Team</strong> You will learn the entire Bronze syllabus and more advanced technique.  The lessons are geared toward competitive dancing.  Semester dues are $80 for students and $120 for non-students.  In order to join the Bronze Team a tryout is required.  These lessons are taught by professional coaches.</li>
<li><strong>Silver Team</strong> This is the same as Bronze except the Silver syllabus is taught.  The dues are the same and a tryout is required.  These lessons are also taught by professional coaches.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul> 

<h3 id="q6">What do my dues pay for?</h3>
<p>Your dues, along with generous support from Student Organizations, help subsidize the cost of bringing in coaches and expenses related to going to competitions (i.e. lodging and/or travel). Dues may also be used for advertising, and purchasing new club equipment (like music, microphones, or music players, and costumes for club-sponsored shows).  For Newcomer competitors who are students, if you pay for your first competition’s entry fee, your dues will be waived.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q7">Why do I have to tryout for Bronze and Silver?</h3>
<p>Passing a tryout ensures that everyone in the lesson has a solid foundation.  Thus more time can be spent on learning rather than catching up.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q8">I want to compete but don't have a partner.  What should I do?</h3>
<p>Let your respective team captain know and every effort will be made to pair you up.  If nobody is available, you can dance Mixed Proficiency at most competitions.  In Mixed Proficiency you will dance with a more advanced partner but only you will be judged.</p> 
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q9">Now that I've learned to dance, where do I go to actually dance?</h3>
<p>There are typically a couple of competitions every semester that members of the club will attend.  The club also holds events like Hot Latin Night and the Halloween dance.  There are also Social dances every weekend at different dance studios around town.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q10">Where can I find out about the above events?</h3>
<p>Please check the club website which has an <a href="http://www.charlottedancesport.org/calendar" title="CDS Calendar" target="_blank">events calendar</a>.  Also check the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2206779566&ref=ts" title="CDS facebook group" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>

<br />
<h3 id="q11">What's the difference between International and American Ballroom?</h3>
<h2>International Ballroom</h2>
<p>This style consists of Standard (Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz, Quickstep) and Latin (Samba, Cha Cha, Rumba, Paso Doble, Jive).  Standard and Latin have a single syllabus that is the same throughout the world.  This makes it more conducive for competitive dancing.</p>
<h2>American Ballroom</h2>
<p> This style consists of Smooth (Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz) and Rhythm (Cha Cha, Rumba, East Coast Swing, Bolero, Mambo).  American is danced primarily in the U.S. and there is more than one syllabus.  This makes it harder to judge.  It is geared more towards social dancing.  The club focuses on International Ballroom.</p>
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q12">Are the dances that International and American have in common (i.e. Waltz, Rumba, etc...) the same?</h3>
<p>They are not the same.  They are similar but there will be different steps and technique.</p>  
<ul><li><a class="top_faq" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<br />
<h3 id="q13">I have a question that has not been answered here.  Where do I go to find more information?</h3>
<p>Send your inquiries via the <a class="contactus cboxElement" href="<?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/send_email.php">contact us</a> form and someone will get back to you as soon as possible.  Any of the current members of the club are also a great resource.
